I am a Ph.D canditate at McGill University studying the biophysics of smooth muscle contraction. 
Since 2020, I’ve been applying biophysical methods to understand how smooth muscle keeps the tone of our airways and blood vessels without using a humangous ammount of energy.
I have a significant ammount of experience with image analysis and object tracking using python.
I'm very interested in the science of aging and longevity.
To learn more about my science and the projects I'm working on, head to matheusschultz.com.
