- 👋 Hi, I’m @sciwithalaser. I am a graduate student with a background in molecular biology and biochemistry.
- 👀 I’m interested in molecular biology, and science communication.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. Like a lot of people, I started coding through the CS50 class from Harvard university which I am taking online.
- 💞️ For now I am not looking to collaborate in any projects, I am concentrating on completing the CS50 class and doing some personal projects.
- 📫 You can reach me through my webesite matheusschultz.com.
